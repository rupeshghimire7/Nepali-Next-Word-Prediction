# Nepali Next Word Prediction


## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of Nepali next word prediction using n-gram modeling and Laplace smoothing. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of news corpus from 2013 to 2023.

## Tasks Completed

1. **Text Preprocessing:**
   - [ ] Describe the steps taken for text preprocessing.

2. **Vocabulary Building:**
   - [ ] Outline the process of building the vocabulary.

3. **n-gram Dictionary Creation:**
   - [ ] Explain how bigram and trigram dictionaries are created using the NLTK library.

4. **Laplace Smoothing:**
   - [ ] Detail the implementation of Laplace smoothing for better model generalization.

5. **Prediction Mechanism:**
   - [ ] Describe the prediction mechanism, particularly how the model predicts the next word in a single-word state using trigrams.

## Deployment

The model is deployed on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rupeshghimire7/ngram-nepali-next-word-prediction).
